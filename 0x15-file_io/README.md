# C - File I/O #
In the C programming language, file I/O (input/output) refers to the process of
reading from and writing to files on disk. The standard library provides
functions for performing file I/O, including:

fopen: This function is used to open a file and return a pointer to a file
stream, which can be used for subsequent I/O operations.

fclose: This function is used to close an open file and free up any resources
associated with the file stream.

fread: This function is used to read binary data from a file into memory.

fwrite: This function is used to write binary data to a file.

fscanf: This function is used to read formatted data from a file into memory.

fprintf: This function is used to write formatted data to a file.
